# FinCEN_SARsData

This is a work-in-progress. This repository tries to aggregate all the publicly available FinCEN (http://www.fincen.gov) data on suspicious financial activity in one, more accessible place. All the CSV data files can be found under the data folder. The files are named according to the industry under which the suspicious activities have been filed and the year (20XX) in which they have been filed.

The industry look-up key is as follows:

CC - Credit Card Club/Casino
DI - Depository Institution
H - Housing GSE
IC - Insurance Company
LFC - Loan or Finance Company
MSB - Money Services Business
SF - Securities/Futures
O -  Other

As of now, we are aware that the Depository Institution data is not fully complete. We are working on it. If you notice any other discrepancies and/or require any clarifications about the data feel free to raise an Issue, or shoot an email to mail [at] subhayan [dot] com. Or to pmurck [at] cyber [dot] law [dot] harvard [dot] edu.
